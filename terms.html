   licensed alcohol beverage retailers,
   and other licensees with retail privileges,
   ("Licensed
    Retailers") for the purchase and sale of such beverages and products, among
    other things. All orders placed through the App or the Website are accepted, reviewed, and ultimately fulfilled by Licensed Retailers. All sales are solely transacted between you and Licensed Retailers. Each product listed on Spacecious is not an offer to purchase such product but an invitation to make an offer by placing an order. You acknowledge and agree that Spacecious does not sell, offer to sell, invite to sell, or solicit any offers. In all instances, all sales are advertised, accepted, made and delivered by licensed retailers who receive all orders and offers. In all instances, any solicitation, invitation, offer, advertisement or communication is void where prohibited by law. Spacecious does not sell or deliver alcohol beverages. No part of the Services is intended to facilitate any improper furnishing of inducements by any manufacturer, importer, supplier, wholesaler or distributor of alcohol beverages to any Licensed Retailer or any improper exclusionary practices by any alcohol beverage licensee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Once the charge is authorized, the Licensed Retailer will package your order for either pick-up, shipment or delivery, as indicated by you in your order request.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
   </span>The individual picking-up the order or accepting the order shipment or delivery must provide a valid form of photo identification proving that he or she is at least 21 years old and sign for the order at the time of pick-up, receipt of shipment or delivery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
   </span>It is solely the responsibility of each Licensed Retailer, and its employees and agents, or the shipping or delivery company used by the Licensed Retailer and that shipping or delivery company’s employees and agents, to verify such proof of identification. Your order request, pick-up, shipment or delivery may be declined for any reason by the Licensed Retailer, or its employee or agent, or the shipping or delivery company used by the Licensed Retailer or that shipping or delivery company’s employee or agent. If declining because the requested item(s) or acceptable substitutions are not in stock, the Licensed Retailer may offer you a full refund.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

The Notice must: (x) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute;

   ">The arbitration will be conducted before a neutral single
    arbitrator, whose decision will be final and binding, and the arbitral proceedings will be governed by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer Related Disputes, as modified by these Terms. The AAA's rules are available at </span><a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/faces/home;jsessionid=BpOnRG2lO6I3Oo6E4GPqem6HuqsMi7RVaDp6VxX2ICtg7kA13ivE!1055348740?_afrLoop=388710714706766&amp;_afrWindowMode=0&amp;_afrWindowId=null#%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D388710714706766%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">ADR.org</span></a><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;"> or by calling
    1-800-778-7879. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this arbitration clause, but the arbitrator is bound by these Terms. If you initiate arbitration, your arbitration fees will be limited to the filing fee set forth in the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules. We will reimburse all other AAA filing, administration and arbitrator fees paid by you for claims totaling less than $10, 000, unless the arbitrator determines that the arbitration was frivolous or brought for an improper purpose, in which case the payment of all such fees shall be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Spacecious for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Spacecious will not seek attorneys' fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines the
    claim or the relief sought is improper or not warranted. The arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, by telephone, online, based solely on written submissions or in person in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts or at a mutually agreed location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
   </span>The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

    APPLICABLE LAW, ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. Further, you agree that the arbitrator may not consolidate proceedings or more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
    representative or class proceeding, and that if this specific proviso is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration clause shall be null and void.

   </span>If a court of competent jurisdiction finds the foregoing arbitration provisions invalid or inapplicable, you and we each agree to the exclusive jurisdiction and the exercise of personal jurisdiction of the state or federal court located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the purpose of litigating all claims or disputes, and waive any objection as to inconvenient forum.

    you except by a writing executed by the duly-authorized representatives of Spacecious. These Terms will inure to the benefit of and will be binding upon each party’s successors and assigns. These Terms and the rights granted under these Terms may be assigned by Spacecious but may not be assigned by you without the prior express written consent of Spacecious. If any provision of these Terms is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision of these Terms will be affected and the remaining provisions will continue to be enforceable and valid according to the terms of such provisions. It is expressly understood that in the event either party fails to perform any term of these Terms and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce not constitute a waiver of any term. Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to constitute either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between Spacecious and you or any third party as a result of these Terms or your use of the Services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
   </span>In the event that either party is prevented from performing, or is unable to perform, any of its obligations under these Terms due to any cause beyond the reasonable control of the party invoking this provision, the affected party's performance
    will be extended for the period of delay or inability to perform due to such occurrence. You and Spacecious agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.
