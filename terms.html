                <small>	10.2 &nbsp; 	Neither us, nor any officer, director, employee, shareholder or our agent shall be liable to the User or any third-party for any claims relating to the purchase, sale, delivery and/or consumption of the alcoholic beverage or any consequences which may result thereof. </small><br>

                <small>	10.5 &nbsp; 	If there is no individual who is 21 years of age or older or cannot provide valid identification showing that he or she is 21 years of age or older or Muslim practices Islam, the delivery driver (“Courier”) will not complete delivery of the Products. Additionally, if the Courier is unable to contact you or the account holder at the specified delivery address for 15 or more minutes, all  Products will be removed from the order and returned to the Retailers and a RM 20 restocking fee will be charged to User’s credit card and the original order balance will be returned to User. </small><br>

                <small> 10.11 &nbsp; 	We cannot guarantee a delivery to anyone other than the intended recipient and additional layer added to delivery can increase the liability and risk that the product may be misplaced.</small><br>
                <small> 10.12 &nbsp; 	If our mover cannot get in touch with you to make delivery, you will receive a notification via e-mail to contact the store and you may be charged for redelivery at the store’s discretion.</small><br>
